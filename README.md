 # Dungeon Master: The Legend of j'0hn

Help j'0hn, hero of the Land of Placeholder, escape the dungeon he's been trapped in by
the dark lord Garblax. Be prepared to hack and slash through hordes of enemies on 
your way to freedom from the depths of dunegon, the third largest dungeon in all of 
Placeholder. Along the way meet a number of characters and enemies, starting with:

### j'0hn, The Hero

Control j'0hn, our hero by using the arrow keys to traverse the various rooms. Use the 
space bar to make j'0hn swing his sword to tear through enemies on your way to escape,
but don't let his health get too low. If you do, our hero will be defeated and the land
will fall into darkness. Keep your eye out for hidden rooms, containing boosts to health,
defense, and speed.

### Silme

The first of Gaarblax's evil minions, the silmes will follow j'0hn throughout the room,
even climbing up walls to get to you. Don't worry too much though, one swing will take out
these green menaces. However, when in a horde these monsters can prove to be a formidable
foe.
